# swiftTUI
Because why use GUIs.

# Disclaimer
This is nowhere near to a productive framework, its is just me throwing in some implementation ideas every now and then.

# Motivation
TL;DR: Why not. Just wanted to have a CLI framework for a language that has mostly been built for use with GUI applications.

# TODO
- Write an actual README proposing the things this framework shall accomplish.
- Start writing simple labels and workflows incorporating [cursesKit](https://github.com/theBreadCompany/cursesKit)

### Implementation concepts
Please have a look at  

# Usage
TODO
