# Concepts

These files are a (more or less) simple database for ideas on how to get this project done.
You will mostly find me rambling about theoretical stuff and examples on how things might look. 

## Table of Contents

### Conceptual
- [SYNTAX](Conceptual/Syntax.md)
- [NAMING ISSUES](Conceptual/Naming.md)

### Production
- [LABELS](Production/Text.md)
- [MENUS]((Production/Menu.md)

## TODO (aka missing concepts)

- actually building the content
